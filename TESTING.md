__*Testing*__
* The testing method consisted of an iterative process which first enabled the Arduino to collect data from the orientation sensors. After that, connection between Bluefruit and Raspberry Pi were added and tested. This was followed by adding the other sensors part by part, continuously testing using serial data and the LED display as reference points. At the end of the project, all sensors, calculation and connection methods worked as intended. The data was also successfully displayed using Grafana.
