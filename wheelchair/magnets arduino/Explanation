An athlete travels a large distance during a game of basketball.
For training purposes, it is interesting to measure this distance.

This can be achieved by placing magnets on the wheelchair's wheels and
DC-1561 surface mount magnet sensors on the wheelchairs frame. Two of these
sensors would enable the system to track in which direction the wheel is moving.
After measuring multiple passages, the travelled distance can be calculated.

THIS MEASUREMENT METHOD WAS NOT CHOSEN

This is due to the inaccuracy of the measurements and the overall capabilities
of the IMU chip.

The measurements of the magnet method are prone to errors due to the need for
large rotations of the wheel before measurement occurs. It also cannot measure
changes in direction or velocity in between passages.

Therefore, we opt to gain this data from a IMU chip placed in the centre of the
wheel, which accurately measures these velocity and directional changes.
